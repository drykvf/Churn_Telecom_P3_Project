# Churn_Telecom_P3_Project
Project in Flatiron

From : Hera K.

# Overview 

For this project I will be using some machine learning algorithm such as SMOTE, pipeline, random forest techniques to analyze the features used in determinig churn of Syria company.

# Business Problem 
I am hired by a Syria company to predict customer churn and how to avoid churn furthermore promote customer retaining

# Data 
I used Syria’s telecom company data from Kaggle dataset. The utilizations provided by company has been used as data for this analysis such as day/evening/night calls, minutes and charges, international calls, minutes and charges, voicemail messages and customer service calls.
Features 
Model 1 : Pipeline without SMOTE
Model 2 : Pipeline with SMOTE

# Results 
The below graph displays that customer service calls makes significant role for churn.  It is obvious that customers left the company after a few call

# Conclusions 
This analysis shows that this company’s plan is inefficient for their consumers and they are pretty much more far away from customer satisfaction. Customer service calls graph explains and supports this event.

# Next Steps 
Tech facilities, text messages, payment methods, internet opportunity, tech supports, protection, movie/ channel packages are not available in the provided dataset. These items should be concerned as a service as well.
Multiple packages for customer’s need / a customized package for their requirements inspires confidence and they can keep this business longer
